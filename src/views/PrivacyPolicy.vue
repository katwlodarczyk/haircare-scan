      <h5 id="1">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h5>

      <p>We collect personal information that you provide to us.</p>
      <p>
        We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when
        expressing an interest in obtaining information about us or our products
        and services, when participating in activities on the Services or
        otherwise contacting us.
      </p>
      <p>
        The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your
        interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make and the
        products and features you use. The personal information we collect can
        include the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        Publicly Available Personal Information. We collect first name, maiden
        name, last name, and nickname; email addresses; and other similar data.
      </p>
      <p>
        All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete
        and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal
        information.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h5>Information automatically collected</h5>
      <p>
        Some information — such as IP address and/or browser and device
        characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our
        Services.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or
        navigate the Services, via Google Analytics. This information does not
        reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information)
        but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address,
        browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
        preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information
        about how and when you use our Services and other technical information.
        This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
        operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting
        purposes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Online Identifiers.</b> We collect cookie identifiers, or others such
        as the ones used for analytics and marketing; and other similar data.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h5 id="2">2. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h5>

      <p>
        We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to
        provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill
        business obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:
        Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent
        to use your personal information in a specific purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably
        necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with
        you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of
        our contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally
        required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental
        requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as
        in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to
        public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement
        requirements).
      </p>
      <p>
        Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is
        necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential
        violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving
        potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or
        as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. More specifically,
        we may need to process your data or share your personal information in
        the following situations:
      </p>
      <p>
        Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in
        connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company
        assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
        another company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third-Party Advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies to
        serve ads when you visit the Services. These companies may use
        information about your visits to our Website(s) and other websites that
        are contained in web cookies and other tracking technologies in order to
        provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
      </p>

      <h5 id="3">3. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h5>

      <p>
        We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
        purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by
        law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this
        is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
        information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
        possible.
      </p>

      <h5 id="4">4. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h5>

      <p>
        We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the
        internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect
        your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
        from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
        services within a secure environment.
      </p>

      <h5 id="5">5. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h5>

      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18
        years of age.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
        years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
        have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:haircare.scan@gmail.com">haircare.scan@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h5 id="6">6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h5>

      <p>
        In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights
        that allow you greater access to and control over your personal
        information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain
        rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the
        right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
        information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict
        the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to
        data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right
        to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a
        request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider
        and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection
        laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
        you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note
        however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
        before its withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are
        unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right
        to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can
        find their contact details here:
        http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
      </p>

      <h5 id="7">7. DATA BREACH</h5>

      <p>
        A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or
        collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You
        will be notified about data breaches we believe you are likely to be at
        risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result
        in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being.
        In the event that we become aware of a security breach which has
        resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of
        personal information, we will promptly investigate the matter and notify
        the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after
        having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely
        to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
      </p>

      <h5 id="8">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h5>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
        technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
        been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h5 id="9">9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</h5>

      <p>
        Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with
        relevant laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version
        will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version
        will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material
        changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently
        posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a
        notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently
        to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
      </p>

      <h5 id="10">10. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY?</h5>

      <p>
        If you have questions or comments about this policy, you may email us at

      <h5 id="h11">
        HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?
      </h5>

      <p>
        Based on the laws of some countries, you may have the right to request
        access to the personal information we collect from you, change that
        information, or delete it in some circumstances. To request to review,
        update, or delete your personal information, please contact us by email
